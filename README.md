# Vanilla JavaScript Weather Application

This is a vanilla JavaScript weather application. It uses geolocation and the Open Weather Map API to get real weather data and display the current weather conditions for any given location. There are also working 3 hour and 5 day forecasts, and buttons which allow the user to convert the unit from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

# What I learned

* HTML5 and CSS3
* JavaScript features such as Functions, Arrays, Loops, Math and ES6 Syntax
* How to retrieve and display real data using an API, as well as Geolocation
